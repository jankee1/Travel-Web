# Travel-Web

This project was done from scratch with HTML5, CSS3 (Flexbox and GRID) and a little bit of Javascript. Main goal was to practice layout creation.

Main features:
* Website is mobile-friendly
* All navbar items are hoverable. 
* Photos in gallery are automatically changed every 2s.
* "Showe more...!" button becomes "sticky" once clicked.
* All photos are taken from pexel.com - website which provides photos that are free to use for individuals and companies.
