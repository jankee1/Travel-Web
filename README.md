# Travel-Web

This project was done from scratch with HTML5, CSS3 (Flexbox and GRID) and a little bit of Javascript. Main goal was to practice layout creation.

Main features:
* All navbar items are hoverable. 
* Photos are automatically changed every 2s.
* "Showe more...!" buttons become "sticky" once clicked.
